# spotify-stats

This is a Spotify statistics tracking website. Similar to Spotify Wrapped, this website displays real-time statistics of your Spotify account using Spotify's API.

To try it out yourself, download the repository and dependencies. Then, enter your spotify client id and client secret in server.js, and start the server on port 8888. After the server is started, go to http://localhost:8888 and login to your spotify account.

Once logged in, the website will serve some user statistics such as top artists and top tracks. Below the list of top artists and tracks is a list of user's private and public playlists. Click on any of the playlists availble to find more information about them with animated graphs!

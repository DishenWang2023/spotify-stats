# spotify-stats

This is a Spotify statistics tracking website. Similar to Spotify Wrapped, this website displays real-time statistics of your Spotify account using Spotify's API.

To try it out yourself, download the repository and dependencies. Then, enter your spotify client id and client secret in server.js, and start the server on port 8888. After the server is started, go to http://localhost:8888 and login to your spotify account.
